This was more difficult than I anticipated!

In this project I learned what it takes to plan ahead with functions..
Whilst writing this, due to lack of experience, it was difficult for me to imagine how the functions will communicate with eachother
so it did end up looking like a big mess.

I anticipate I will need to write a couple more projects before my code becomes more tidy.

In the future I will look to making specific functions for collecting data and outputting data. In this one I definitely repeat myself a lot.

Good learning!
